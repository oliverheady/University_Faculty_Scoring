# University_Faculty_Scoring
Used Python to build and execute a correlation analysis on a data set about business faculty at universities in a region of the U.S. 

The header row of the data set includes column names, each of which has meaning as noted below.

facid: Unique identifier for each record in the sample.

n1, n2, n3, n4: Four different survey items each measuring a faculty member’s narcissism. Higher scores correspond with more-narcissistic traits.

m1, m2, m3, m4: Four different survey items each measuring a faculty member’s Machiavellianism. Higher scores correspond with more-Machiavellian traits.

s1, s2, s3: Three different survey items each measuring a faculty member’s sociopathy. Higher scores correspond with more-sociopathic traits.

Gender: The faculty member’s gender.

TenureTrack: Whether the faculty member is a tenure-track faculty member (=”y”) or not (=”n”). No differentiation is made between tenured tenure-track faculty and those who have not yet come up for tenure.

CourseRate: Average of student course ratings (scale of 1-5) over the last school year.

GPA: Average grade given by the faculty member over the last school year (on a four-point scale where A = 4, B = 3, etc.). In other words, if you average all the grades received by this professor’s students in this professor’s class over the last year, this is the value of that average.

LrnOutcome: Average student learning outcome decile (based on scores on standardized test questions) over the last school year. A value of 4 indicates that, on average, that faculty member’s students score in the fourth decile.
